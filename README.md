**Tools Used:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)  
**Focus Areas:** Operational Analytics | Temporal Analysis | Spatial Insights | Decision Support

##  Project Overview

This project presents an exploratory data analysis of passenger demand patterns for a metropolitan transit network (MetroMove Transit Solutions).

The objective was to move beyond surface-level metrics and identify **when and where passenger demand concentrates**, translating raw operational data into insights that support scheduling, capacity planning, and resource optimisation.

##  Business Context

Transport networks operate within time-sensitive and location-sensitive systems. Understanding demand fluctuations across stations and hours is critical for:

- Service frequency optimisation  
- Capacity planning  
- Staffing allocation  
- Congestion management  
- Data-driven operational strategy  

This analysis demonstrates how structured exploratory analytics can inform such decisions.

##  Analytical Approach

The analysis followed a structured workflow:

###  Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Handled missing values and inconsistencies  
- Standardised categorical variables  
- Engineered time-based features (Departure Hour)  
- Applied cyclical encoding to preserve the circular nature of time  

###  Descriptive & Univariate Analysis
- Distribution of passenger counts  
- Transport mode comparisons  
- Station-level demand overview  

###  Temporal Analysis (Hourly Resolution)
- Aggregated passenger demand by departure hour  
- Identified peak travel windows  
- Evaluated time-of-day demand concentration  

###  Operational & Spatial Insights
- Built a station-by-hour demand heatmap  
- Identified station–hour pressure points  
- Highlighted patterns relevant for service planning  

---

## Key Insights

- Passenger demand demonstrates clear peak-hour patterns consistent with commuter behaviour  
- Demand intensity varies significantly across stations  
- Hourly aggregation provides interpretable and decision-ready operational visibility  
- Visual heatmaps effectively surface spatial-temporal congestion patterns

##  Relevance to HealthTech & Digital Operations

Although this project focuses on public transport data, the analytical framework directly mirrors operational challenges in healthcare and digital health systems, including:

- Patient flow analysis  
- Workforce scheduling optimisation  
- Clinic and ward capacity planning  
- Time-based service demand forecasting  

The core principle remains the same: **transform operational data into decision-ready intelligence.**
